[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/afc84778-c397-49c8-830f-b158663bc378/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/identity-icon-gen/deploys)

Run the application locally. The first time the component is rendered, an identity icon is randomly generated. If you like it, you can then download it in the format of your choice (`.png` || `.jpg`). 

Other options are also available:

- Click on the "play" button and launch an automatic generation of avatars based on the xorshift algorithm. When you click, a new generation takes place, click as many times as necessary until you find the icon you prefer.

- Click on the "retry" button to launch a step-by-step generation. One icon after another will be generated, giving you more time to analyse its contents.

The interface also offers a preview in the context of use. To do this, we simulate the interface of your GitHub profile. You will then be able to see the final rendering of the generated avatar. Enter your GitHub username to display your personal data.

Have fun!
